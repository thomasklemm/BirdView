Paymill does not enter into possession of the funds to be transferred (Section 1, Par. 10, No. 9 ZAG [Payment Services Regulation Act]). The Paymill application can be accessed by means of an application service providing via a data processing interface established by Paymill for this purpose (hereinafter – interface). The merchant’s data processing systems are connected to the interface by the merchant in accordance with the documentation about the Paymill application available at www.paymill.de and www.paymill.com (hereinafter – documentation). The Paymill application, the interface, and the documentation will be referred to collectively as the Paymill platform.
