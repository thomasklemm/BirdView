            @johndoe Hi John,

            thanks for asking. Our Space Suit will be a good match for your trip to the outer orbit. We protect you from Radiation as much as p</strong>ossible. Hereâ€˜s why:

              * Our Space Suit is made from a custom high tech fabric specially developed in our labs. Its thick fibers include threads of lead and aluminium, which helps you get out of harms way.
              * We specially designed the outer coating to be resistant to heat, space trash, and especially gamma radiation, which is kinda awesome.

            Can we help with anything else? Feel free to reach out here on Twitter <br>
            or contact sales@spacesuitsinc.com for a custom quote.

            Thanks for asking, have a great day!

            Sincerely, <br>
            Martha from Space Suits Inc.
