TWEETBOX shall nonetheless endeavor to keep TWEETBOX Web sites available without interruption. Events related to maintenance, security or capacity requirements, and/or events beyond TWEETBOX's control (e.g. disruptions in public communication networks, power failures etc.), may result in brief malfunctions or temporary interruptions of the services provided on TWEETBOX Web sites.

  ## 3. Registration, and Representations and Warranties upon Registration

  ## 4. Right of cancellation for consumers
    If a user is registered at TWEETBOX for a purpose that is not related to either his or her commercial or freelance activity, the following provisions apply to him or her as a consumer under the law (§13 German Civil Code):

  #### Right of cancellation
    The User may cancel registration for the Free and Paid Memberships in writing (e.g. by letter, fax or email) within two (2) weeks without stating a reason. The two-week period begins when membership is activated by TWEETBOX.
    Furthermore, the User may cancel registration for the Paid Membership in writing (e.g. by post, fax or email) within two (2) weeks without stating a reason, after changing from Free Membership to a Paid Membership. The two-week period begins when Paid Membership is activated by TWEETBOX.
    All Paid Memberships have a 14 days trial version in which the user can cancel the membership at any time. After the 14 days trial, the payment is done and an invoice is issued. After receipt of the invoice the user can not cancel the current payment.
    For meeting the cancellation deadline in each of the aforementioned cases, the date of dispatch of the cancellation notice is decisive. In each of the aforementioned cases, the cancellation notice should be sent by post to Thomas Klemm, Minnesängerstr. 18, 97688 Bad Kissingen, Germany. The User may deliver notice of termination using the contact form available at all TWEETBOX Web sites, or by sending a fax or letter to TWEETBOX. The fax number and email address of TWEETBOX can be found at http://www.TWEETBOX.com/imprint.
    The User's right of termination under section "Termination of Membership, Reimbursement of Advance Payments" shall not be affected by the User's cancellation right under this section.

  #### Premature lapse of the right of cancellation
    In accordance with §312d Par. 3 BGB (German Civil Code), the User's right of cancellation lapses before the end of the right of cancellation period cited in the previous section, in the following cases.
    If TWEETBOX has begun performing the TWEETBOX services for which the User is registered with the express consent of the User, or if the User has initiated the TWEETBOX services for which the User is registered (e.g. in which the User has accessed the TWEETBOX services that TWEETBOX has made available to the User in accordance with the type of Membership chosen by the User at registration).

  #### Consequences of cancellation
    In the event of a valid cancellation of a Paid Membership, both parties shall be obliged to restore any benefits already received in accordance with legal provisions, and issue any gains (e.g. interest). If the User is unable or partially unable to restore the benefits, or only able to restore them in poor condition, to TWEETBOX, then the User must reimburse TWEETBOX for the corresponding value. The User must fulfill obligations for reimbursement within 30 days after dispatch of the cancellation notice.

  ## 5. Obligations of the User
    The User is obliged to refrain from using any pseudonyms or pen names.
  #### To comply with all applicable legislation, and respect all third-party rights. In Particular, the User shall not
    Use any insulting or defamatory contents, regardless of whether said contents are directed at another user or TWEETBOX personnel or other companies
    Use any pornographic materials or any contents that violate any applicable legislation for the protection of minors; or advertise or promote, offer or distribute any pornographic product or products which do not comply with any applicable legislation for the protection of minors
    Unreasonably annoy (particularly with spam) any other user (cf. §7 of the German Unfair Competition Act)
    Use without authorization any contents protected by law (e.g. by copyright, trademark, patent, utility patent, or design patent laws), or advertise, promote, offer or distribute any goods or services protected by law.
    Use or promote any commercial practices considered unfair competition, including progressive customer acquisition practices (such as chain distribution systems, multilevel selling or pyramid sales).
  #### The User is prohibited from the following:
    Employing any mechanisms, software or scripts when using TWEETBOX Web sites. However, the User may use the interfaces or software provided by TWEETBOX within the scope of the services available on the TWEETBOX Web sites.
    Blocking, overwriting, modifying and copying of any contents of the TWEETBOX Web sites, unless said actions are necessary for the proper use of the services on the TWEETBOX Web sites. For example, the use of the "Robot/Crawler" search engine technology is not required for proper use of the services, and is therefore prohibited.
    Distributing or publicly disclosing the contents of any of the Web sites of TWEETBOX or any other user
    Performing any actions which may impair the operability of TWEETBOX's infrastructure, particularly actions which may overload said infrastructure.

  ## 6. Changes to the Services on TWEETBOX Web sites
    TWEETBOX reserves the right to modify the services offered on the TWEETBOX Web sites and/or to offer services different from those offered at the time of the User's registration at any time, unless this is unreasonable for the User.
  ## 7. Termination of Membership, Reimbursement of Advance Payments
    The User may terminate the Free Membership at any time without cause. The User may deliver notice of termination using the contact form available on all TWEETBOX Web sites at any time. The termination notice shall include the User's registered name and an email address of the User registered on one of the TWEETBOX Web sites.
    The User may terminate without cause the Paid Membership to the end of the minimum runtime chosen by the User in the course of the registration process, or to the end of any renewal period after said minimum runtime expires, by giving notice of fourteen (14) business days. The user may deliver notice of termination using the contact form available on all TWEETBOX Web sites, or by sending a fax or letter to TWEETBOX. The termination notice shall include the registered name of the User and an email address of the User registered on the TWEETBOX Web sites. If the User has terminated the Paid Membership, the User is entitled to retain a Free Membership until such termination takes effect. The provisions of this section shall not affect the right of both parties to terminate the agreement for good cause.
    A good cause is defined as an event which makes it unacceptable for TWEETBOX to continue the agreement to the end of the termination period, taking into account all circumstances of the individual case and weighing the interests of TWEETBOX against the User's. A good cause includes any the following events:
    If the User fails to comply with any applicable legal provisions
    If the User breaches a contractual obligation, in particular an obligation set forth in sections 3 and 5 of these GTC
    If the reputation of the services offered on the TWEETBOX Web sites is substantially impaired by the online-presence of the User (if, for example, it is discovered after registration that the User has been convicted of a criminal offence, and if said conviction is known to other users);
    If the User promotes any communities or associations (or any of their methods or activities) which are under surveillance by authorities responsible for public safety or the protection of minors, or;
    If the User causes harm to any other user(s)
    If the User is a member of a religious sect or a denomination that is controversial in Germany.
    In the event of a good cause in accordance with this section and notwithstanding TWEETBOX's right to terminate the contract in accordance with this section, TWEETBOX is entitled to:
    Issue a warning, or
    Block the User's access to the services on the TWEETBOX Web sites.
    In the following cases, the User shall not be entitled to claim reimbursement of any advance payments:
    If TWEETBOX has terminated the contract for good cause pursuant to section 7,
    If TWEETBOX has blocked the User's access in accordance with section 5, or
    If the User has terminated the agreement. However, the User's right to claim reimbursement of any advance payments shall not be excluded in this case if the User has terminated the agreement for a good cause attributable to TWEETBOX.
  ## 8. Responsibility for the User's Content, Data or other Information
    TWEETBOX does not make any warranties or representations regarding any data and/or information provided or made available by any user on any of the TWEETBOX Web sites or on any external websites linked to them. In particular, TWEETBOX does not warrant or represent that said data and/or information is true or accurate, or that it fulfils or serves any particular purpose.
    The User may report any activities of any other user which violate applicable laws adn/or any of the terms and conditions of these GTC (including the use of pseudonyms or false identities) using the contact form available at all TWEETBOX Web sites.
  ## 9. Customer Service/Support
    Queries regarding agreement with TWEETBOX or regarding TWEETBOX services can be sent by the customer to TWEETBOX using the contact form available at all times on all TWEETBOX Web sites, or by sending a fax or letter or just by tweeting to us @TweetboxHQ.
  ## 10. Liability of Tweetbox
    Whatever the legal grounds, liability for damage claims based only on ordinary negligence against TWEETBOX (including its vicarious agents) shall exist only if TWEETBOX breaches a basic/cardinal obligation under this agreement. In this event, the amount of claims are limited to typical and foreseeable damages.
    Limits shall not apply to the extent damages are covered by TWEETBOX's business liability insurance, provided the insurance company has effected payment to TWEETBOX. TWEETBOX undertakes to maintain the insurance coverage existing at the time this agreement is concluded.
    This shall not affect personal injury and property damage claims based on the German Product Liability Act.
  ## 11. Indemnity
    The User shall indemnify and exempt TWEETBOX from all actions, including damage claims, asserted by other users or third parties against TWEETBOX resulting from an infringement of their rights by the contents posted by the User on TWEETBOX Web sites. Furthermore, the User shall indemnify and exempt TWEETBOX from all actions, including damage claims, asserted by other users or third parties against TWEETBOX resulting from an infringement of their rights regarding the use of the services on TWEETBOX Web sites by the User. The User assumes all reasonable costs TWEETBOX incurs due to an infringement of third party rights, including all reasonable legal-defense costs. All other rights, including damage claims by TWEETBOX, are hereby unaffected.
    The aforementioned obligations shall not apply to the extent the User is not responsible for the infringement.
    In the event the contents posted by the User infringes any rights of any third party, the User shall, at its own expense and at TWEETBOX's discretion, either obtain the right to use said contents or render said contents free of any infringement. In the event the User infringes third-party rights when using the services of TWEETBOX Web sites, the User shall discontinue such use that violates these General Terms and Conditions and the law, if so requested by TWEETBOX.
  ## 12. Data Protection
    TWEETBOX recognizes that any data provided by the User to TWEETBOX is extremely important to the User, and TWEETBOX shall therefore be particularly sensitive in handling such data. TWEETBOX shall comply with all applicable legal provisions regarding data protection (German Data Protection Laws, European Data Protection Directives and any other applicable data protection legislation). In particular, TWEETBOX shall not provide or otherwise disclose any personal data of the User to any third party without authorization. Details on TWEETBOX's treatment of the User's data are set forth in the Privacy Statement of TWEETBOX accessible from each of the TWEETBOX Web sites.
  ## 13. Right to Contents
    When the User posts his or her contribution to a forum, the User grants TWEETBOX an unlimited, irrevocable and assignable right of use for the respective contribution, which TWEETBOX is entitled to utilize for any purpose. In particular, TWEETBOX is entitled to keep said contribution on the forum, and on its Web sites and the Web sites of its partners, or use it for marketing the forum in any other way.
    Consequently, TWEETBOX has a right of use over all contributions to discussion forums it operates. Duplication or the use of these contributions or their contents in other electronic or printed publications is prohibited without the express written consent of TWEETBOX. Copying, downloading, dissemination, distribution and storing of the contents of TWEETBOX and/or third parties, with the exception of the cache memory when searching for forum pages, is prohibited without its express consent.
    Any other content (longtweets) belong to the user and TWEETBOX fully recognizes this rights.
  ## 14. Final Provisions
    These GTC and any amendments thereto must be in writing to be valid. No secondary agreements exist.
    TWEETBOX reserves the right to amend these GTC at any time, without giving reasons, unless an amendment is unreasonable to the User. TWEETBOX shall give due notice of any amendments of these GTC to the User. If the User does not object to the applicability of the revised GTC within two (2) weeks after receipt of said notice, the amended GTC shall be deemed to be accepted by the User. TWEETBOX shall inform the User about the User's right to object and of the relevance of the objection deadline in said notice.
    Unless otherwise stated in these GTC, the User may submit all notices to TWEETBOX using the contact form provided on each of the TWEETBOX Web sites, or by letter or fax. TWEETBOX may send notices to the User by email, fax or post to the addresses given in the User's current contact data in his or her user account.
    If any provision of these GTC is, for any reason, invalid and/or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. The parties agree to replace an invalid and/or unenforceable provision with a valid and/or enforceable provision which most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the invalid and/or unenforceable provision. This also applies to contractual loopholes.
    The place of performance under these GTC shall be TWEETBOX's main place of business.
    Place of jurisdiction, insofar as legally admissible, shall be the main place of business of TWEETBOX.
    These GTC and the contractual relationship shall be governed by German Law, excluding international private law and the provisions of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods that have been adopted by German Law.
