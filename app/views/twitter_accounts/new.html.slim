/ p Alternatively, you can authorize us to just read your tweet but not send out any ones. Your decision should depend on what you'd like to do with the individual account. If you want to handle tweets and send out replies, you should grant full access. If you want to authorize a <b>secondary account</b> to perform more search queries per timeframe but do not want to tweet from this account, read access is just fine.
