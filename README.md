# Tweetbox

**Twitter for teams.** Tweetbox is no longer developed or maintained, but can serve as a source for guide and style. It employs many practices found in the community [Ruby](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) and [Rails](https://github.com/bbatsov/rails-style-guide) style guides, as well as patterns I've learned about over time.

Learn and (re)use parts at your own discretion.
