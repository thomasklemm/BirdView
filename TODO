READY TWEETS
  - make sure conversation has been downloaded before polling happens
  class Tweet
    twitter_created_at:datetime <- from twitter
    created_at:datetime <- rails timestamp
    ready_at <- set by conversationworker

  fetch all tweets with ready_at greater than last time polling has happened
  this would mean we'd have to index ready_at
